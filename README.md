# Text-Based Hangman Game

Welcome to the Text-Based Hangman Game! This is a simple command-line text-based version of the classic word guessing game. The objective is to guess the letters in a randomly selected word before you run out of lives.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Enter Your Name:**
   - When prompted, enter your name.

3. **Guess a Letter:**
   - The game will display the current state of the word with underscores representing unguessed letters.
   - Enter a letter to guess if it is in the word.

4. **Win or Lose:**
   - If you correctly guess all the letters before running out of lives, you win!
   - If you run out of lives, you lose and see the correct word.

## Rules

- The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
- You have 6 lives to guess the word.
